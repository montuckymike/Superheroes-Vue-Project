This is my first fullstack vue/express/mongoose application.  
To run our database whenever we restart or start our computer we *Must* fun:

sudo mongod

Then leave that command/terminal prompt window open  in which we ran the command.

Requirements:
- Node/NPM Packages:
  - ExpressJS
  - body-parser
  - Mongoose

and can be installed via command :

  npm install --save express body-parser mongoose
